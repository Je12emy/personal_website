Back in 2019, my father bought me an e-bike. Back then, this was a very new trend. I have used this bike to commute back and forth around my town, and I must say that it has saved me a ton of money on Ubers. Still, I must admit that many years later, I am left with a nearly unusable bike. Yes, batteries are supposed to degrade over time, but buying a new battery costs nearly as much as buying a brand new bike. 

I can understand the price on phones, battery replacements are kinda hard to pull off. But on e-bikes? The battery is meant to be easily removed! I am left with two options, buy a new battery or just buy a reglar old bike which I can use for longer road trips. Hell, I could put that money into my car and fix a ton of issues.

If you buy an e-bike, at least verify the price of new battery replacements.
